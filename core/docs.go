/*
Package core is the architectural backbone of the framework.

It defines the universal standards, interfaces, and lifecycles that govern
how the system operates. The actual technical implementations (e.g., specific
database drivers, service discovery clients, or server protocols) are
located in the 'pkg' directory to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
